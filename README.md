## Future Scope

I see myself as a web-developer for something inovative.
In general I **Love** being involved into design atmosphere.

Proposals to myself in life could change if I find a company in which I feel fulfiled,
I'm used to be flexible, as Bruce Lee said **"Be a Water My Friend"** find happiness
In places you have not thought about.

But for now...

I have bright idea of being a part of Web-development company, but
to me it's very important to have a possionate team leader from whom I could learn.

I'm used to taking responsibilities and I'm **thriled** of being the one of responsible people in company
because I trust my guts and I believe that I can find what is right for everyone.
