I have experience with Graphic design tools of Adobe: **PS / Ai**

Been a photographer, still am, but for my personal preferences.

### Scope of future

I see myself as a web-developer working with retail market clients.
In general I **Love** being involved into design atmosphere.

Proposals to myself in life could change if I find a company in which I feel fulfiled,
I'm just used to being flexible, as Bruce Lee said **"Be a Water My Friend"** find happiness
In places you might not thought about, because in reality it's actually impossible to
know where is your place it's just state of mind we put ourselves in. IMHO.

But for now...

I have bright idea of being a CEO of my own Web-development company,
Its just that I'm used to taking responsibilities and I **Love** being the one
that can try to bend things the way I decide to.
