## Welcome Traveler, Take a Look Around!

### In General

 - I'm currently studying JavaScript and its frameworks.
 - By studying I mean **~38%** of week.
 - Don't worry, sleeping full 8 hours a day **~32%**.
 - Physical activity shares about **~7%**.
 - Remaining part is mostly being lazzzy...
 - Just kidding, I'm also working, but work-time mixes with studying Sooo...
 - Besides, as a hobby I'm selling... Anything... depends on situation,
  but at the moment I'm managing online retail store. Damn those logistics...

### Software Scope

Programming languages: **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**

I have experience with Graphic design tools of Adobe: **PS / Ai**

Been a photographer, still am, but for my personal preferences.

### Scope of future

I see myself as a web-developer working with retail market clients.
In general I **Love** being involved into design atmosphere.

Proposals to myself in life could change if I find a company in which I feel fulfiled,
I'm just used to being flexible, as Bruce Lee said **"Be a Water My Friend"** find happiness
In places you might not thought about, because in reality it's actually impossible to
know where is your place it's just state of mind we put ourselves in. IMHO.

But for now...

I have bright idea of being a CEO of my own Web-development company,
I'm just used to taking responsibilities and I **Love** being the one
that can try to bend things the way I decide to.

### Gaming section

I used to play competitive games but right now I just like to spend
that time on games in a dumbest way possible, use it as a playground.
So if you want to have dumb time I might be down for it.
